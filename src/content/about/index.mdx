title: 'Thanks for dropping in.'

Front end web development is my sweet spot. I'm obsessive when it comes to building designs to spec. (I'm also obsessed with olives. And guacamole. Let's just say all food...).

Building UIs with modern tools excites me. Writing code that's readable and well tested so that others can count on me to be a positive contributor is important to me. I enjoy learning as technology evolves, and I'm persistent when it comes to understanding how something works.

Moreover, I enjoy learning from or alongside others through code review and pair programming. I'm incredibly grateful for the mentorship I've received thus far. It has motivated me to write code better than yesterday as well. Sometimes I learn outside of work, too, like how I played around with Gatsby, GraphQL and styled components to build this website.
